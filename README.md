# Rendon-TX-Community-Map

## Project Purpose
This repository was created to continue my GIS skills for creating GIS web maps, using QGIS applications and plug-ins.

## Introduction
This project supports a leaflet map built using the qgis2web plug-in for the QGIS mapping application.  The project, itself, 
contains data for the spatial location of a projected and controversial J7 Ready-Mix concrete batch plant (Pending Permit 172856)
in the community center of Rendon, Tx. Buffer zones show the distance from the projected concrete batch plant and the various 
residential areas, that could and may be affected.

Additionally, I have provided the TxDot projected widening and altering the 1187 Farm to Market Road (FM 1187).  This data came from 
.pdf files I downloaded after attending a TxDot community meeting.  After Geo-referencing the .pdf files into the map, I then digitized all 
the provided ROW data from the Raster layer.  The ROW data provided in this GIS map was not created by an 'on the ground survey' and is for 
not information purposes only and should not be used for surveying or engineering purposes.

## Map Data Resources
GIS vector data provided in map is from free downloaded sources.\
	**Tarrant Appraisal District (TAD.org)**\
	**Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (tceq.texas.gov)**\
	**Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT.gov)**\
GIS Base Map data is from QuickMapServices plug-in for the QGIS application.

## Technical Resources
QGIS application (version 3.28.10-Firenze) was used to geoprocess and set symbology for GIS data.  
Base code is from the **qgis2web** plug-in for use by the QGIS application.
